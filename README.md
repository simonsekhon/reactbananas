## Description

Built this application using React/Redux. Used Axios to make API calls to the Node.js Backend.

## Installation

```bash
cd reactbananas
yarn or npm install
```

## Get started

```bash
yarn start
```

## Missing Requirements

Optional features are missing due to time constraint but focused on the overall architecture and design. Also missing the net profit and not providing a way to stop selling expired bananas which is also due to time constraint.

## Conclusion

Focused my time on the react/redux design and coming up with ways to properly show and store data from the backend. The layout I also focused on at a high level with react router navigation and properly displaying the right information when a route changes.
